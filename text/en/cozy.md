join and administer a real-time, collaborative community

The {{aka}} command is the primary tool for creating a collaborative online community (think "coworking") and interacting with it in real-time.

* `who`  - output short summary about a person suitable for all Twitch chat to see
* `stat` - give the over time statistics about a community member
* `ping` - get a real-time status about a person, their mood, are they online, busy, etc.
* `work` - current project summary of what a person is actively working on
* `todo` - public todo list with progress and percentages
* `pomo` - control one's own pomo timer or use the default for the community
* `mood` - what is the person's current mood, this is popular on GitHub as well
* `week` - upcoming public calendar for the coming week (only), optionally recurring
* `note` - send a short offline note to someone (or oneself), with delivery date
* `post` - post a temporary micro-blog message including links to other longer posts
* `time` - start one of several personal timers
* `poke` - setup an alert for oneself sort of like an alarm at a given time, possibly recurring
* `poll` - activate a poll to expire within a given time frame
* `vote` - vote for a currently active poll

Administrators can enable one or more of these commands through community chat interfaces by either moderators or everyone.
